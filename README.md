# HowToCreateReactApp
A guide on how to use a create react app.

## Getting Started:

step 1: Run the following and go grab a coffee because it will take a few minutes.<br>
<code> npx create-react-app <my-app-name> </code>

<p> Note: if you get an error make sure that you have node and npm install. You can check with <code> node -v </code> and <code> npm -v </code>. Also make sure you run <code> nvm install --lts </code> to install the latest LTS (long-term support) release of Node.js. </p>p>

step 2: Get into the created directory.<br>
<code> cd <my-app-name> </code>

step 3: Run the following to start the server.<br>
<code> npm start </code>

Note: You can delete all the files inside <span>/src</span> and start from scratch. Inside <span>/public</span> the root is already there.
